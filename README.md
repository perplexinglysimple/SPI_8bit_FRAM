# SPI_8bit_FRAM

This driver is for arduino and was developed to be used with the LightAPRS Tracker. 

All the parameters are configurable so this should work with any arduino

This also includes configurable at compile time error detection and correction of stored data.
This is not visable to the application but will ensure that data is stored and will be recovered.

More to come when I finish writing this and testing this.
